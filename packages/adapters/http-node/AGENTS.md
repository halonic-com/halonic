# @halonicjs/adapter-http-node

Owner: ravi · Layer: adapters · Read the root `AGENTS.md` first; this file adds local rules.

## Scope

The Node HttpClient for outgoing requests that refuses addresses: it resolves a name, checks every address against the host's class, connects to the address it checked, and decompresses the response itself.

This package may change only through tasks that name it. Its public API is `src/index.ts`;
everything else is internal.

## Commands

| Command                                                                                | What it does                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm exec turbo run test --filter=@halonicjs/adapter-http-node -- --maxWorkers=2`     | runs this package's tests (and the codegen they need)                      |
| `pnpm exec turbo run lint --filter=...[origin/main] --concurrency=2`                   | lints the packages your change touches and the ones that depend on them    |
| `pnpm exec turbo run test --filter=...[origin/main] --concurrency=2 -- --maxWorkers=2` | tests the packages your change touches and the ones that depend on them    |
| `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --concurrency=2`                                        | typechecks all packages (HAL-2950); unchanged ones come from Turbo's cache |

Don't run `pnpm verify` by default: CI runs the full suite (HAL-2418).
